Task 1 - Data Preprocessing \& Visualization

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This task focuses on the fundamental steps of data preprocessing that are essential before applying any machine learning model.

The notebook main.ipynb demonstrates how to clean and prepare a dataset by handling missing values, dealing with categorical features, removing outliers, and performing basic visualizations.



ðŸ”‘ Key Steps

Handling Missing Values



Detecting missing data

Imputing with mean/median/mode or dropping rows/columns

Dealing with Categorical Variables



Encoding categorical values (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding)

Converting categorical features into numerical representations for ML models

Removing Outliers



Identifying outliers using statistical methods (IQR, Z-score)

Dropping or capping outliers to make data more robust

Visualization



Distribution plots, histograms, and boxplots

Correlation heatmaps for understanding feature relationships
